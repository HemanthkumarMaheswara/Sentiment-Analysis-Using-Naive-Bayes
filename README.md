# Sentiment Analysis Using Naive Bayes

## Overview
This project aims to build a **Sentiment Analysis Model** using the **Naive Bayes Algorithm**. The model classifies customer reviews as **positive** or **negative**, enabling businesses to gain insights into customer feedback and improve their products or services.

---

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, stop-word removal, and vectorization.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Utilizes the Naive Bayes algorithm for text classification.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates the model using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
- **Extendable Architecture**: The project is structured for future enhancements.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python  
### Libraries:
- **scikit-learn**
- **pandas**
- **numpy**
- **matplotlib**
- **nltk**

### Tools:
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Google Colab**

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python (version 3.6 or higher) should be installed on your system.
- Install the required libraries by running the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib nltk


# Usage

## Prepare the Dataset
- Provide a CSV file containing customer reviews and their corresponding labels (e.g., "positive", "negative").

## Run the Script
The script will:
1. Preprocess the text data.
2. Train the Naive Bayes model.
3. Evaluate its performance.

## View the Output
- **Predictions**: Classifies new reviews as **positive** or **negative**.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Accuracy Score
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score

---

# Output

## Sentiment Predictions
- Classifies reviews as **positive** or **negative**.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Accuracy Score**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**

---

# Future Enhancements

- Implement additional machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM) for performance comparison.
- Expand the dataset to include multilingual reviews.
- Deploy the model as a web application for real-time sentiment analysis.
